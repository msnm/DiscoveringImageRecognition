#DiscoveringImageRecognition
In this repo I'm exploring how to recognise CAPTCHA's.

#Setup
Create your own virtual environment by running the following commands:


```
python3 -m venv env-deeplearning
source env-deeplearning/bin/activate
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib
pip install keras.preprocessing
pip install sklearn
Pip install ImageCaptcha
```

The setup can be tested by running the scripts in the MNIST folder:
```
python helloKeras.py
python mnist_keras.py
```

To reset the source env-deeplearning to the global env type:
```
deactivate
```
